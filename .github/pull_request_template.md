# Homebrew Tap Release Process

This PR adds support for automatically publishing releases to our Homebrew tap repository. This is part of the work for #43, though this PR alone doesn't complete all the requirements.

## Changes

- Added Homebrew tap configuration in `.goreleaser.yaml`
- Configured GitHub Actions workflow to handle tap updates
- Added SSH key setup for secure tap repository access
- Set up proper versioning and artifact handling for Homebrew releases

## Testing

- [ ] Verify that the tap formula is generated correctly
- [ ] Test the installation process using the tap
- [ ] Verify version handling works as expected

## Notes

This is the first step in implementing #43. Additional PRs will follow to complete the full release process requirements.
