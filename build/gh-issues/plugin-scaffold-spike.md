## Background
We need to explore creating a plugin scaffolding feature that will help developers create new plugins for Titanium. This spike will focus on using Dagger.io for the implementation.

## Goals
- [ ] Create a new plugin type for scaffolding
- [ ] Implement basic scaffolding functionality using Dagger.io
- [ ] Support template-based generation
- [ ] Ensure generated files are properly structured
- [ ] Add cleanup support via `mage clean`

## Technical Details
- The scaffolding plugin should be able to:
  - Generate plugin boilerplate
  - Set up basic project structure
  - Create necessary configuration files
  - Initialize git repository (optional)
  - Set up build tooling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Plugin can be installed via `ti plugin install scaffold`
- [ ] Generated plugins follow project structure guidelines
- [ ] Generated files are properly cleaned up by `mage clean`
- [ ] Documentation for using the scaffolding feature
- [ ] Example templates for common plugin types

## Implementation Notes
- Consider using Dagger.io for the implementation
- Generated files should be placed in `build/` directory
- Templates should be version controlled
- Consider supporting custom templates

## Questions to Answer
- What should the CLI interface look like?
- How should we handle template versioning?
- What validation should we perform on generated code?
- How should we handle dependencies in generated plugins?

## Time Estimate
- 3-5 days for initial implementation
- Additional time for testing and documentation
