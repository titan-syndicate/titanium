# Plugin Command Registration Improvements

## Changes
- Added support for registering plugins as top-level commands
- Plugins can now be executed directly (e.g., `ti scaffold` instead of `ti plugin exec ti-scaffold`)
- Added detailed logging for plugin registration and execution
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing plugin commands

## Testing
- Verified plugin discovery and registration
- Tested command execution with both old and new formats
- Confirmed logging provides useful debugging information

## Related Issues
Closes #43 (but keeping open for additional improvements)

## Notes
This change improves the user experience by making plugin commands more intuitive to use. The old `plugin exec` command is still available for backward compatibility.
